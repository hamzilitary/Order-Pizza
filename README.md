## Description

_{The purpose of this Webpage is to order pizza and get the dollar amount based on the size of the pizza, the type of bread of the pizza, and the topping you would like to add. }_
##Specs

_Created an object that held the values of size, bread, and toppings. Then created a points system that assigns points to the different option values of each key in the object. Created a determinePrice variable that assigns a dollar amount to different ranges based on the combination of the three inputs and there allotted points. Less than or equal to 4 give you 10$ between 5 and 7 points returns 15$ and everything else over 7 gives you 20$. Then front end logic was created to verify the results and finally the styling using bootstrap and CSS were added._
